<h2>About Me:</h2>
  Aspiring IT professional with a comprehensive background in cybersecurity, IT support, and strategic problem-solving. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Western Governors University, with graduation slated for November 2024. Holding an Associate of Science in Cybersecurity from St. Petersburg College, I am equipped with a solid foundation in the field, bolstered by the CompTIA trifecta (A+, Network+, Security+) and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification.

  My journey in IT has been both challenging and rewarding, starting with my role as an IT Support Specialist for a small business. Single-handedly managing the entire IT infrastructure, I addressed a variety of technical issues daily, from onboarding/offboarding employees and issuing desktops/laptops to handling complex tasks such as repurposing servers into a Proxmox virtualized environment and implementing Wazuh SIEM on Ubuntu LTS. These experiences honed my ability to adapt, innovate, and drive efficiency in high-stress environments.

  One of my significant achievements was reducing the number of servers from sixteen to five using Hyper-V, significantly cutting maintenance costs and improving operational efficiency. Additionally, I successfully negotiated vendor contracts, slashing the IT budget by 25% while maintaining top-tier services.

  With a passion for technology and continuous learning, I am also preparing for the Project+ exam and have ambitions to expand my cloud knowledge further and pursue the CISSP certification. My dedication to the field is evident in my proactive approach to problem-solving and my commitment to enhancing both my technical and soft skills.
