<h2>About Me:</h2>
I worked as an IT Support Specialist for a small business with a Data Center that would envy many medium-sized companies from 2008 - 2016.
I am the sole IT employee and is therefore responsible for all things IT and with an aging infrastructure I am kept busy with a variety of issues all day long. 
In this my first role, I have performed basic tasks such as onboarding/offboarding employees, issuing Desktops/Laptops, and providing access/permissions to hardware/software necessary for the duties.
However, I also performed more sophisticated tasks such as repurposing a server as a Promox virtualized environment and installing Wuzah SIEM on Ubuntu LTS.
The data center previously employed a single server for a single role which for a small business isn't so ideal for maintenance and cost so I used Hyper-V to reduce sixteen servers to five.
Yes, I got hired to do a basic desktop role and ended up negotiating contracts with various Vendors and finding ways to reduce the budget spent on IT equipment, this business could no longer afford.
So while some would complain of the additional work and lack of pay, I fully embraced it because of my love for IT.
